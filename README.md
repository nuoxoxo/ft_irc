# Todos:

__Makefile__ :: add usage
- [ ] Run server side:
  - `$ ./ircserv <port> <pass>`
- [ ] Run client side:
  - `$ ./irssi` then `/connect <host> <port> <pass>` or\
  - `$ nc <hostip> <port> <pass>`

__command__ :: `CAP LS`

# Q&A

### `netcat`
- if no password is entered using
  - will show msg :: "You need to enter a pass!"
  - will close client :: `close( this.m_socket_incoming ) ;`
- if nothing follows a `NICK ` or nick is taken
  - will send RPL `ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME`
  - will close client


### NAMES, `/names`, `/n`

- on connection to a channel, w/o explicitly sending /NAMES
  - the client (IRSSI) sends an initial NAMES command to retrieve a list of users in the current channel
  - this is the first thing the client does, even if we don't have the NAMES command
- on receiving a NAMES command from client (IRSSI)
  - Even though our server does not implement the NAMES command, Irssi stills function normally and display the user list because it ignores the error message returned by the server


### Valid port

- `[6660, 6669]`, `6679`, `6697`
- standard port: `6667` (standard port for IRC connection)
- typical range: `[6660, 6669]` or `[6660, 7000]`
- for secure connections
  - 6697 = standard port for SSL-encrypted IRC connections
  - 6679 = an alternative port for SSL connections
- `[*, 1024]` = "well-known ports" reserved for specific services or applications


### About user

anonymous!anonymous@anonymous
- "anonymous" (1st one) refers to the user's Nickname
- "!anonymous" refers to Username
- "@anonymous" refers to Hostname

eg. `john!johndoe@example.com`


### Separator set

- `:` - Used to indicate the start of the message body or the text of a message
- `!` - Used to separate a user's nickname from their username or hostname
- `@` - Used to separate a user's username from their hostname
- `#` - Used to indicate a channel name
- `&` - Used to indicate a channel name for networks that support both channels and groups
- `+` - Used to indicate a mode change to grant a user voice in a channel
- `%` - Used to indicate a mode change to grant a user operator status in a channel
- `.` - Used in some commands to separate the server name from the command or argument
